I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Milan, where I also completed my Master's degree with honors. My research centers on enhancing video game accessibility through AI-powered partial automation, with the goal of making interactive entertainment more inclusive for players with disabilities.

Currently, I conduct my research at the EveryWare Laboratory, where I explore innovative approaches to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and accessibility solutions in gaming environments.
